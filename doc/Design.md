# Design of Matryoshka

## Motivation
The Matryoshka server is developed to create instant mock server for frontend team 
especially when:
* the backend teams can't deliver the API at the beginning phase
* when backend is composed from several micro services which developed by different teams
* when mock API needs to be merged with existing API while. 

Traditional API development requires frontend developers to wait for a long time until they can test the api

With Matryoshka server, frontend developer can directly jump to api development without waiting for backend team.
